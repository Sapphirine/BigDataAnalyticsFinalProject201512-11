# Passenger-and-Driver-Based-Analytics-of-NYC-Taxi-Database
This project is aimed at providing a multi-angle, all around online open platform for public. To achieve this goal, we did real-time analytics for taxi drivers and passengers based on tweets, and further customized visualization analytics results about taxi trips for passengers and drivers. We provide the services according to the specific needs. For the driver-based, we offer driver license renew reminder, pickup location recommendation to maximize driversâ€™ profits. For passenger-based, we offer trip fare and time estimation, popular boarding location recommendation, disabled service request and popular routes based on pickup location.
